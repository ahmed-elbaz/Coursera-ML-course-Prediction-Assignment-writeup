# Coursera-MachineLearningPredictionAssignment-R

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively.  

One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, our goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways and we will try to predict whether or not the exercises performed by participants used proper form or not.
